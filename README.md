### Key Elements in a Wireframe

 - Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
 - Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
 - Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
 - Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

### Types of Wireframes

 - Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
 - High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

### Recommended: Figma

Figma is a cloud-based interface design and prototyping tool used widely by UX/UI designers, developers, and product teams.

  - Browser-based & Cross-platform: No need to install software — works in any modern browser.

 - Real-time Collaboration: Multiple users can design and comment simultaneously, making team workflows smoother.

 - Design + Prototyping: Create wireframes, high-fidelity designs, and interactive prototypes all in one place.

 - Component System: Reusable elements help maintain consistency across screens.
    Version History: Easily track changes and revert if needed.


##  Wireframing 

Wireframing is a foundational step in software development and UI/UX design. It provides a visual skeleton of a digital product, helping teams align on structure, functionality, and user flow before investing time in high-fidelity design or development.


#l  Clarifies Ideas and Concepts

Wireframing translates abstract ideas into visual structures. It helps both designers and stakeholders visualize the layout, hierarchy, and interactions early in the process — turning ideas into actionable design elements.


# Facilitates Communication

Wireframes serve as a universal language between developers, designers, product managers, and stakeholders. Everyone can quickly understand the proposed structure, which ensures alignment and reduces misinterpretation.


# Identifies Usability Issues Early

By focusing on structure and flow, wireframes help catch problems like poor navigation, unclear CTAs, or overwhelming information placement before development begins.
